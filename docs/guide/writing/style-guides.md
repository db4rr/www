# Style Guides

A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of content, defining the style to be used in communication within a particular organization. Basically, style guides are put together to clarify [the way a group of people talk and write about the things they do](http://www.writethedocs.org/style-guide/). Think of authoring best practices.

If you happen to have a background in academia or journalism, you will probably be familiar the [AP stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook) or the [Chicago manual of style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style). Those are great resources for writing in general, particularly for grammar and syntax, but if you're reading this page chances are you are considering style in the context of technical documentation.

There are style guides that help you write a variety of content, such as documenting the methods of an API, or presenting a overview of complex technical concepts, or focusing on how to write particular deliverables like user manuals, release notes, or tutorials.

Other style guides help you communicate to developers, product managers, the general public, etc. Others provide best practices on how to manage your content, version control, or publication and delivery strategies.

## Why do I need a style guide?
A practical reason to use a style guide is that they help you author content. Human languages are extremely flexible, and there are in which a particular message can be communicated. By following a style guide you limit all that variation, making it easier for you to focus on getting your message across. This makes style guides extremely useful for people joining projects.

Style guides also increase consistency in your content. There are good reasons why you want to keep consistent tone, voice and style in your documentation. Marketing-oriented folks understand the importance of voice and tone in building a brand identity, but consistency also has a big impact on how effectively you communicate -- that is, on how well you manage to transfer a particular information to your audience.

There's actual science behind this. Our brains appear to be hardwired to identify differences -- anything that stands out from its context will catch our attention. A lot of variation will drain our cognitive resources, making it more difficult for us to assimilate information. The degree to which cognitive resources are drained varies between people, but in general it is a good idea to minimize the [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) of your communications.

## Different styles for different folk

Choosing the right style guide for your project depends on your particular context:
  - Who you are
  - Who you are writing for
  - What you are writing about
    
Good writing takes its audience into consideration and adjusts to the needs and expectations of that audience.
We have selected a number of style guides resources for a variety of context -- hopefully you'll find something that suits you and your project.

> If you really need to pick a style guide ***right now***, we recommend you take a look at the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/)

    - [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov)
    - [Open SUSE Style Guide](https://doc.opensuse.org/products/opensuse/Styleguide/opensuse_documentation_styleguide_sd/)

Technical documentation takes many forms, each one targeting a certain need. Here, we can think of examples like tutorials, API documentation,  and user manuals. Each of these have specifiities that the the others don't share. So while style guides can adequately cover the main concerns of technical documentation, additional style guides can offer more targeted guidelines.

They focus on how to make technical content readable, clear, engaging, succinct, etc., or they discuss mechanics like punctuation and spelling guidelines, or how to reasonably order conten.
